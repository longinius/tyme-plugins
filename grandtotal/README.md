# GrandTotal Invoicing

Tyme provides two types of built-in plugins for the [GrandTotal](https://www.mediaatelier.com) invoicing app: 

The **Invoice Plugin** which lets you create invoices from billable times in Tyme automatically and the **Offer Plugin** that enables you to automatically add clients, projects and tasks from a GrandTotal draft invoice to Tyme.

You just have to install their GrandTotal Part. Please refer to the [GrandTotal Plugin Guide](https://www.tyme-app.com/en/grandtotal-plugin) on how to install it.
